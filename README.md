- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rolandxxx
- 👀 I’m interested in codeing with Lazarus / Free Pascal
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to get better with this (and to improve my english)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything in/on/with Lazarus
- 📫 How to reach me via Mail: Rolandxxx "at" rl-syz.de


The zip-files which you can download here contain small tools for your desktop: 
Download in a new directory and unzip. If there is a .xxx file then rename the extension back to .exe. In the
text-file you can find some explanation about the tool and what it is good for (so far only in German. Tell 
me if you need(!) an english version. And: Windows only. So far tested with Windows8.1 and Windows10)

Any other questions, suggestions, ... ? You want the sourcecode? Don't hesitate to send a mail. 

HTH
Roland
