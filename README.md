The zip-file which you can download here contains a small tool for your desktop: Cockpit_NG3.exe (Windows only) It can be 
used to clear your desktop, sort multiple files / programs / links and have them always ready for use / call. A little bit
like a menue for everything.
You can define how many tabs you want (max 90) and how many buttons per tab (max 48). You can use the integrated color
or choose your own for every button. You can define a preview picture for every button.

The picture 1 to 5 might give you an idea how this is working.

Download in a new directory, unzip and enjoy

Tell me if you need(!) an english version. Any other questions, suggestions, ... ? Don't hesitate to send a mail.

CU
Roland
